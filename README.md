# Insurtech-Visualisation-Project
This project is a visualization tool developed for an insurtech startup, focused on analyzing vehicle collisions across California. It covers various collision types, including trucks, 
pedestrians, mopeds, and buses, and maps the data on a per-capita basis across a California map. The goal is to provide actionable insights for insurance risk assessment and 
urban planning.
